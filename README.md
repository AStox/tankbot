tankbot
=======
An attempt to teach myself the python scripting language by making a simple game on the Blender Game Engine. The game is a top down, tank game similar to the tank game on Wii Play. The game currently only features a start menu and simple AI test level.

A .Blend is included in this repository along with all the code I've written so far.

Suggestions and tips are appreciated and can be sent to Adamstox@gmail.com.
